# Building a brand that feels local

In a city where Mexican eateries are quickly becoming the norm, I was tasked with uncovering what makes Taquiza, a small independent restaurant in Peckham, stand out. Despite serving delicious, affordable food and being rooted in its community, the restaurant wasn't reaching its full potential. The tables weren’t consistently full, and the brand didn’t seem to resonate beyond a loyal local base.

My first challenge was to answer:

**Why would someone choose Taquiza over other restaurants with similar offering?**

To answer that, I started with what was already there—analysing their existing creative assets, exploring customer feedback, and reviewing social media performance. The brand was operating without formal guidelines, borrowing its creative direction loosely from its parent space, The Carpet Shop—a beloved grassroots music venue in Peckham.

What I discovered was a lack of narrative cohesion. While the team was clearly passionate, their visual identity and messaging felt improvised. Their social media was a patchwork of well-meaning posts, but with no unified voice or visual consistency. Despite having a great product, Taquiza wasn’t telling its story—and in a competitive food scene, story matters.

**Great Food Needs Great Storytelling**

I spent time with the team, shadowing their day-to-day activities and speaking with customers. The food was undeniably good—fresh, beautifully presented, and accessible. Yet, the missing ingredient wasn’t on the menu: it was brand storytelling.

The more I listened, the clearer it became: Taquiza was more than just a restaurant. It had the potential to become a “third place” for the community—a cultural and social space where people felt they belonged.

To build that identity, I grounded the brand in authentic Mexican street food culture, using design references from Mexican Rótulos—the vibrant, hand-painted signs that colour the streets of Mexico. These bold visuals reflect both tradition and urban energy, perfectly mirroring Peckham’s eclectic spirit.

At the same time, I needed to maintain a connection with The Carpet Shop’s identity. So I blended that handcrafted aesthetic with a modern, colloquial tone—one that felt warm, playful, and familiar.On social media, I reimagined the visual direction around:

High contrast colours and bold typography to reflect energy and flavour.A friendly, accessible voice to strengthenthe connection with the local audience.Visual consistency and a strong narrative thread in every post.

# **The story**

*From Puebla to Peckham*

Taquiza is a vibrant Mexican restaurant in Peckham, led by chef Sam Tarneberg. Inspired by his time in Puebla, Mexico, where he met the love of his life and reconnected with his passion for cooking.

Growing up in Peckham, Sam always dreamed of giving back to his community. The kitchen felt like home, but it was the warmth of the Comal and the Mexican hospitality that truly shaped his culinary journey.

Back in London, Sam and his partner Joana opened Taquiza as part of The Carpet Shop structure. The restaurant is a unique spot for the community, offering tasty meals, refreshing drinks, and great music. Their vision is simple: to provide honest food at affordable prices for a memorable dining experience!

Taquiza is a place filled with memories, where the community comes together to create new stories and experiences! It’s a warm, welcoming space that invites everyone to share laughter, joy, and delicious food while building lasting connections.

# **A brand that belongs**

What emerged was more than a new look. We created a brand that felt lived-in and alive—a place that stood for quality, culture, and community. The story became the glue between the food, the people, and the place.

Since the rebrand:

- Social media engagement significantly increased.
- Return customers began to recognise and mention the new identity.
- The team felt more confident sharing content that reflected their values.
