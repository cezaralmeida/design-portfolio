# Taquiza - Building a brand with Local Soul
**Cocina Mexicana** | Peckham, London | April, 2025

Taquiza is a small Mexican kitchen led by chef Sam Tarneberg, whose time in Puebla deeply shaped both his cooking and his connection to community. Despite strong food and loyal regulars, the restaurant struggled to stand out in London’s crowded Mexican dining scene. Their brand lacked structure, consistency, and a straightforward narrative.

My role was to identify what truly made Taquiza unique and translate that into a cohesive identity.

Through on-site observation and customer conversations, it became clear that Taquiza wasn’t just serving meals — it was emerging as a “third place” for the neighbourhood. The brand needed to reflect that warmth and rootedness.

I rebuilt the visual direction by blending references from Mexican rótulos — bold, hand-painted street signage — with the contemporary character of The Carpet Shop (their parent venue). 

The system focused on:
- High-contrast colours and strong typography
- A warm, approachable tone of voice
- Consistent, story-led social content

The outcome was a brand that felt grounded, lived-in, and unmistakably local. The team gained clarity and confidence, and the community responded immediately.
